# Rust Basics

This project shows the basic concepts of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and follows [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Complete each module by resolving the test failures.
The suggested order to complete the modules is the following:

* variables
* types
* functions
* flow

To run the tests, execute the following in a terminal at the root of the project:

```console
$ cargo test --doc
```
